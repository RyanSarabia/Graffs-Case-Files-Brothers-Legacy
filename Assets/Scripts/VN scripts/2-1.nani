A few days have passed since the entry test was given to me by the master detective. 
Cases we've been tackling can get quite hectic at times. And while I never thought that this profession would be easy, I had to put my nose on the grinder sometimes.
The agency the master works at specializes in cases of theft. And master Warshall is most known for being adept in recognizing the escape paths of the thiefs.
There was once where we had to stakeout a house in order to catch a prolific thief in the neighborhood.

A whole night of caffeine probably didn't do too well for my body that day. I couldn't even sleep the day after.
Well, it's just the way some cases are after all, no way around it.

I ruminated on the ordeals I had faced these past few days as I entered the agency. 
I noticed that the master's coat was already on the coat hanger as I stamped my time card. 
A few ashen leaves were lying on the ground by the coat hanger. He must have been out doing some investigations again.

Leo: Good day sir, have new cases come by? Oh, give me a moment I'll brew a fresh batch of tea.
@char Master
Warshall: Good day to you too Leo, no new cases have come so far. So for the rest of the day we'll just be handling paperwork.
Leo: Here is some freshly brewed tea sir. 
As I was pouring the tea in the master's cup I noticed that his signature glove on his left hand was nowhere to be seen.
Leo: Are you not wearing your glove today sir?
Warshall: Ahh, I accidentally got it dirty so it's in the cleaners for a moment. Hmm, this tea is good, did you change the tea leaves?
Leo: Yes, the tea shop had some new leaves in stock so I got those alongside the ones we usually have.
Warshall: The fragrance is light and soothing, and the aftertaste lingers after you sip.
Leo: I'm glad you like it sir.

We had some small talk before we eventually settled down on our paperwork.

Leo: Hopefully when a new case comes we can just take it easy.
Warshall: Well, if you hope for too much you might accidentally jinx yourself instead I say.

The telephone rings in the office. The master picks it up after two rings.
Warshall: Hello, this is Warshall detective agency at your service. How may I help you?
Warshall: The Kruskal Diamond has been stolen?
Warshall: I see.
The master's face grimaced.
Warshall: Alright, I'll be there in an hour.
Leo: Sir, is it a new case?
Warshall: Indeed, not just any normal one though. This one may seem like a tough case to crack. 
Warshall: Prepare to set out for the museum. It appears that an important artifact was stolen past midnight. 
Warshall: We shall go to investigate more about this case.
Leo: Yes sir!
