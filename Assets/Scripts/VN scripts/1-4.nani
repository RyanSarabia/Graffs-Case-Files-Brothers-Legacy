Now, I wonder where the cat could be hiding...
Leo surveys the park for the tiny creature. Red leaves are scattered around the grass as the autumn air breezes on his skin.
Hm? I think I see something over there.
From the north entrance, Leo manages to spot an orange Tabby trotting on the park path.
That... must be the missing cat, however how do I catch it? Rushing in from the front would just scare it away.
Judging from it's walking path it appears to be going to the south exit, if I can't catch it by then it would lead to bigger problems finding it in the city.
I would have to intercept its path sneakily and capture it. Time to execute this plan of action.
